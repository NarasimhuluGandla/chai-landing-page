### 3. Design Rationale (2-3 sentences)
Use this text from `DESIGN_RATIONALE.md`:

```
The design embodies royal elegance through a sophisticated color palette of golds 
(#D4AF37, #FFD700) and deep browns (#3E2723, #5D4037) against cream accents, 
complemented by serif typography (Georgia) and a custom animated crown logo that 
establishes brand prestige. Subtle fade-in animations and interactive hover effects 
create a luxurious user experience while maintaining fast performance, and the 
mobile-first responsive design ensures the premium aesthetic translates seamlessly 
across all devices. The layout prioritizes the countdown timer and email capture to 
drive engagement while the warm gradient background and floating ornamental elements 
reinforce the brand's heritage and exclusivity.
