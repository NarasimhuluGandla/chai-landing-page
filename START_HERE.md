## 🚀 What You Need to Do (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Test the Landing Page (5 minutes)

Open terminal and run:

```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser and verify:
- Logo animates with floating crown
- Countdown timer is running
- Email form validates (try invalid/valid emails)
- Social icons have hover effects
- Responsive design (resize browser window)

Press Ctrl+C to stop the server.

### Step 2: Install Git (5 minutes - if needed)

Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win

Install and restart your terminal.

### Step 3: Create GitHub Repository (5 minutes)

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name: `royal-chai-landing`
3. Description: "Premium Coming Soon landing page for Royal Chai"
4. Make it **Public**
5. **DON'T** check "Add README" (we have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 4: Push Code to GitHub (5 minutes)

Run these commands (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username):

```bash
cd C:\Users\naras\chai-landing-page

# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Royal Chai landing page"

# Connect to GitHub (REPLACE YOUR_USERNAME!)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/royal-chai-landing.git

# Push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 5: Deploy to Netlify (10 minutes)

**Option A: Via Website (EASIEST)**
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Sign up/Login with GitHub
3. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
4. Choose GitHub
5. Select your `royal-chai-landing` repository
6. Settings are auto-configured (Build: `npm run build`, Publish: `dist`)
7. Click "Deploy site"
8. Wait 1-2 minutes
9. Copy your live URL (e.g., `https://abc-royal-chai.netlify.app`)

cmd /c "npm install -g netlify-cli"
cmd /c "netlify login"
cmd /c "netlify deploy --prod"
```

## 📤 Assignment Submission

You need to submit **THREE ITEMS**:

### 1. Live Link
Your Netlify URL (e.g., `https://abc123.netlify.app`)

### 2. GitHub Repository URL
Your repo URL (e.g., `https://github.com/yourusername/royal-chai-landing`)

### 3. Design Rationale (2-3 sentences)

**Copy and paste this:**

```
The design embodies royal elegance through a sophisticated color palette of golds (#D4AF37, #FFD700) and deep browns (#3E2723, #5D4037) against cream accents, complemented by serif typography (Georgia) and a custom animated crown logo that establishes brand prestige. Subtle fade-in animations and interactive hover effects create a luxurious user experience while maintaining fast performance, and the mobile-first responsive design ensures the premium aesthetic translates seamlessly across all devices. The layout prioritizes the countdown timer and email capture to drive engagement while the warm gradient background and floating ornamental elements reinforce the brand's heritage and exclusivity.
